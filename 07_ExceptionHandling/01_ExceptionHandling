As we write programs, there might be errors due to which our program will not work as expected and will crash out.
The process to handle these errors, and maintain the smooth running of application is known as exception handling.

The errors are of two types, i.e.
1. Compile time errors: The one which occurs while compiling the code.
2. Run time errors: The errors which occurs while the application is running.

The compile time errors can be easily detected by the java, and solved at that particular time only. But the problem is with run time errors.
The run time errors are hard to catch and can occur anytime.
For example: While getting some data from database, the connection is interrupted because the database server crashed. Hence, there is run time error.

We majorly use exception handling for run time errors.
