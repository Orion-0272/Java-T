The program which gets executed is known as a process.
Dividing these process into smaller units, which could work independently and share same memory are known as threads.

For example: Let's suppose, there is a server which takes the request of user and do some operations, then send result.
When the server have single thread, the server could do only one thing at a time like while doing operation, it could not take another request.
But when we use multiple threads, one for taking request, one for doing operation and last one for sending the result, then each could work independently.
This enables the server to handle multiple task at the same time. If we make multiple thread for doing operation, then we could process multiple request at the same time.

The complete process of creating multiple threads for a particular work, this is known as multithreading.

There are two ways to create thread:
1. Extending the `Thread` class
2. Using `Runnable` interface.
