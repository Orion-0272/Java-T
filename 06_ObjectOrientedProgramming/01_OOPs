Object Oriented Programming (OOPs):
Object Oriented Programming is a way of writing the code that organizes everything around objects.
                                OR WE CAN SAY
Object-Oriented Programming is a programming style where we structure programs using objects.

Objects:
An object is a real-world entity (just like car, pen, human being, etc.) represented in software program.
An object can have any number of properties and behaviour.
For example: A pen can have properties like brand, color, ball or gel pen, etc. and behaviour like write, etc.
Another example: A car can have properties like brand, color, engine, etc. and behaviour like move, stop, etc.

Class:
A class is a user defined datatype or blueprint for an object. It defines the properties and behaviour an object may have.

Pillars of OOPs:
There are four main pillars of object oriented programming, which makes it best for organizing the code.
1. Inheritance
2. Encapsulation
3. Abstraction
4. Polymorphism
