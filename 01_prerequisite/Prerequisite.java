/*
Syntax:
The syntax is a grammar for the programming language. This tells how to write the statements of the program, how things are decelared and used.

For example: int variable = 4;
This is a syntax to initiliaze the variable with value 4.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comments:
The comments are the part of the source code which is ignored by the compiler or interpreter.
It is written by a programmer to tell what the piece of program do or the purpose of the program.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scope:
In Java, the scope determines the accessibility of variables, objects, and functions from different parts of your code.
It's essentially the set of rules that governs where a variable can be accessed and used.

for example:
Block 1: (scope)
{
   int a = 10;
   System.out.println(a); // Result: 10 as variable a defined in this scope is 10.
}

Block 2: (Scope)
{
    int a = 20;
    System.out.println(a); // Result: 20 as variable a defined in this scope is 20.
}

Both a's are different as their scope is different.
