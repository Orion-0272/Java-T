Control Flow:
Control Flow Statements in Java are used to control the order in which statements are executed in a program. They decide which block of code runs and when.
They are of two types, i.e.
1. Decision making statements: Decision-making statements let your program make choices and execute different code depending on conditions.
   if-else
   switch

2. Looping statements: Repeatedly execute a block of code based on a specified condition. These statements are essential for tasks requiring repetition.
   while loop
   do-while loop
   for loop
